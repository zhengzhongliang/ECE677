# ECE677
In this Project I trained an simple LSTM network using TensorFlow on MNIST. A special feature is that the training is parallelized. The training can be finished using 2 GPUs, and this is achieved by Parallel Gradient Descent. For comparison, I also inlcude experiments conducted using Multilayer Perceptron. A report about this project is availale [here](https://github.com/zhengzhongliang/zhengzhongliang.github.io/blob/master/ProjectDocs/ECE677_ProjectReport_ZhengzhongLiang.pdf).
